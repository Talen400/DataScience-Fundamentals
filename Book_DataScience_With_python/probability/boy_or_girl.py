Learning teorem of probality: 
P(E, F) = P(E)P(F) => inconditional
P(E|F) = P(E, F)/P(F) => conditional 
 
This script is a problem if conditional probability about boy or girl.

Whats a probality a event "two girl" (B) be condicionality by "older kid is a girl"(G)?

P(B|G) = P (B, G)/P(G) = P (B)/ P (G) = 1/2

But what is probality when least a kid is a girl? (L)

P (B|L) = P(B,L)/P(Ã‡) = P (B)/ P(L) = 1/3

And this script respond this:

values:     P (B|G) = P(both | older)
            P (B|L) = P(both | either)
